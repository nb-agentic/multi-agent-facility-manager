hvac_analysis:
  description: |
    Analyze temperature data: {temperature_data}
    
    Consider these critical factors:
    1. Current temperature vs optimal range (20-24°C)
    2. Rate of temperature change and trends
    3. Energy efficiency implications
    4. Server performance requirements
    5. Historical patterns and predictions
    
    Provide detailed analysis with:
    - Recommended cooling level (low/medium/high/emergency)
    - Clear reasoning for the decision
    - Energy efficiency notes
    - Risk assessment if no action taken
    
  expected_output: "JSON format with cooling_level, reasoning, energy_notes, and risk_level"

power_analysis:
  description: |
    Analyze power consumption and optimization: {power_data}
    
    Evaluate:
    1. Current power load vs total capacity
    2. UPS battery status and backup readiness
    3. Power distribution efficiency across zones
    4. Cooling power requirements from HVAC decisions
    5. Cost optimization opportunities
    
  expected_output: "JSON with power_status, efficiency_score, recommendations, and cost_analysis"
security_analysis:
  description: |
    Analyze security event data: {security_data}
    
    Evaluate the following:
    1. Event type (e.g., unauthorized_access, perimeter_breach, system_tampering)
    2. Location and timestamp of the event
    3. Severity level (low, medium, high, critical)
    4. Correlation with other system events (e.g., power fluctuations, network outages)
    
    Provide a detailed security assessment with:
    - threat_level: (informational/low/medium/high/critical)
    - response_protocol: Recommended immediate actions (e.g., dispatch_guard, lock_down_zone, review_cameras)
    - impact_assessment: Potential impact on facility operations
    - reporting_requirements: Who needs to be notified
    
  expected_output: "JSON with threat_level, response_protocol, impact_assessment, and reporting_requirements"
network_analysis:
  description: |
    Analyze network performance data: {network_data}
    
    Evaluate the following:
    1. Bandwidth utilization and latency across key segments.
    2. Packet loss and jitter rates.
    3. Network hardware status (switches, routers).
    4. Potential security anomalies (e.g., unusual traffic patterns, DDoS indicators).
    
    Provide a detailed network status report with:
    - network_health: (optimal/stable/degraded/critical)
    - performance_metrics: Key metrics like latency, bandwidth, packet loss.
    - optimization_actions: Recommended actions (e.g., reroute_traffic, increase_bandwidth, isolate_segment).
    - security_advisory: Any potential security concerns.
    
  expected_output: "JSON with network_health, performance_metrics, optimization_actions, and security_advisory"
coordination_task:
  description: |
    Analyze the combined facility status report: {facility_status_report}.
    The report contains summaries from HVAC, Power, Security, and Network agents.

    Your primary goal is to identify inter-dependencies and potential cascading effects.
    1. Review all agent assessments.
    2. Identify any conflicting recommendations (e.g., HVAC needs more power, but Power agent wants to shed load).
    3. Develop a coordinated action plan that prioritizes overall facility stability and safety.
    4. The plan should specify actions for each agent if required.

    Provide a high-level coordination directive with:
    - overall_status: (green/yellow/red)
    - priority_event: The most critical event to address.
    - coordinated_plan: A list of clear, actionable directives for specific agents (e.g., "HVAC: Maintain current cooling. Power: Reroute non-essential load. Security: Increase monitoring in Zone B.").
    - justification: A brief rationale for the plan.

  expected_output: "JSON with overall_status, priority_event, coordinated_plan, and justification."
